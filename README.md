# EducationOne

This project aims to combine the power of data visualization and D3 for a better education portal.

## Introduction 

The portal will work similar to plunkr.io or codepen.io in a educational environment. Just like html or JS code snippets are shared and edited and modified, textual information can be shared and edited for a collaborative experience.

A central archival repository will act as a storage for all.

## Major Components

### TextPlay
The editor will act as scratchpad for playing around with the text

### Parser
The text from TextPlay will be parsed using RegEx and Draftjs to covert to a specific json format.

### Visuals
The visual section will visualize the text entered in the TextPlay area.

### Central Repository
The central repo will contain all the notebooks

## Hierarchy of Entities
