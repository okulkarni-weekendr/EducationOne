# EducationOne
This project aims to combine the power of data visualization and D3 for a better education portal.

##Introduction
The portal will work similar to plunkr.io or codepen.io in a educational environment. Just like html or JS code snippets are shared and edited and modified, textual information can be shared and edited for a collaborative experience.

A central archival repository will act as a storage for all.

The project is still under development, stay tuned
